## Building and running this project
This project uses [Fabric](https://fabric.io) for Crashlytics. The API key is not checked into the repository, to build the project, you need to create a `app/fabric.properties` file and include your own Fabric apiKey and apiSecret. See the `app/fabric.properties.sample` file if you need a reference.
