      "When fermentation is complete, siphon the mead (it is now mead!) into a new vessel. Be careful not to splash too much, nor to suck up too much of the sediment on the bottom (but some doesn't hurt anything). At this stage, you can add the crushed campden tablet to the new vessel. The siphoning action should dissolve it sufficiently.",
      "When it is clear enough that you can read a newspaper print through it, it is ready to bottle, but you can also allow it to bulk age."

      "It will ferment super fast to dry (about 13% alcohol) because of type of yeast and all the nutrients and natural sugars in Welch's grape juice. It should be to SG=1.000 or less in 14-21 days max.",

      "It will stabilize and clear fast. Let it clear and set for another 2 weeks and it will be ready to bottle and drink.",
      "It will be medium sweet but smooth and drinkable right away. If you want it semi sweet use 4 oz honey instead of 6 oz / gal.",

      "Color is deep red, has nice legs on sides of glass after swirling, good nose and great balanced taste) Just don't tell everybody you used Welch's. I won't. Because the juice is clear to start, clearing is naturally fast, fast, fast."
